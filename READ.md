### Splatter

Throughout the different iterations of my sketch, I began to enjoy the spontaneity or how my sketch could evolve by playing around with different functions, arrays, and for-loops. Although I like to have some sort of a plan before going into a sketch, which I did have, it was also quite exciting to see how far an original idea can take you.

I was intrigued by the "soft body" dynamic in p5.js, and the more that I played around with the different colors, speeds of rotation, and key codes, the more my shape started to look like a splash of paint rather than the original "soft" shape (especially when it moves faster). While researching new media artists at the beginning of the semester, I came across several artists who attempted to mimic non-media forms of art (i.e. paintings) through code. I was fascinated by that idea, and so I wanted to play more with my sketch to make my shape look more like the non-media form of art that is splatter paint. 

To do this, I randomized the color of the "splash" and changed the possible speeds of rotation to create several different colors and shapes of splashes. I also wanted an interactive aspect, so I added that participants can toggle between rotation speeds using the arrow keys (and, thus, creating different types of "splatter" marks). The splash image in the background further serves to demonstrate the resemblance of the interactive shape to splatter paint.
